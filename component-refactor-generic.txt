You are performing BASE COMPONENT SCAFFOLD CREATION ONLY for <componentName>.
This prompt MUST be repeatable (idempotent). Do NOT assume any prior run.

DOCS (SOURCE OF TRUTH):
https://ant.design/components/date-picker

TARGET DIRECTORY (ONLY AREA YOU MAY TOUCH):
src/components/<componentName>/

ALLOWED EXTRA TOUCH (ONLY IF YOUR PROJECT REQUIRES IT):
- Update barrel export(s) to expose the component (e.g. src/components/index.ts)
- Nothing else.

AUTONOMY:
- No questions, no confirmations.

GOAL:
Create/verify a minimal wrapper component base that compiles and appears in Storybook:
- Wrapper forwards props to the underlying source implementation (when applicable)
- Correct types file
- Correct index export file
- Minimal SCSS file
- Minimal Storybook story so it shows up in the sidebar

IDEMPOTENT RULES (PREVENT REPEATED MISTAKES):
- If src/components/<componentName>/ does NOT exist:
  - run: npm run plop <componentName>
  - proceed only if it succeeds
- If it DOES exist:
  - DO NOT rerun plop
  - DO NOT delete existing files unless they are clearly broken scaffold stubs

IMPLEMENTATION RULES (GENERIC):
- Wrapper must be named <componentName> and default-exported from:
  src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.tsx
- Wrapper must:
  - accept props as React.ComponentProps<typeof SourceComponent> (or equivalent)
  - forward all props
  - forward ref when the source supports it (use React.forwardRef)
  - forward className/style without overriding
  - NOT invent new public props
  - NOT change runtime behavior (no extra logic, no styling hacks)

MINIMUM FILES (MUST EXIST AFTER):
- src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.tsx
- src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.types.ts
- src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.scss
- src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.stories.tsx
- src/components/<componentName>/index.ts
- Update central barrel export ONLY if your repo uses it

STORY MINIMUM (MUST WORK):
- CSF3
- `const meta = { ... } satisfies Meta<typeof <componentName>>;`
- One basic story that renders the component with a safe default example
- No advanced docs extraction here (this is scaffold only)

TYPE SAFETY (HARD GATE):
- Run: npx tsc --noEmit
- Fix TS errors introduced by scaffold until ZERO errors remain
- Do NOT use `any` or `@ts-ignore`

CHANGE VERIFICATION:
- Run: git diff --name-only
- If component directory did not exist and now still does not exist → FAIL
- If changes touched files outside allowed scope → FAIL

OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "scaffoldReady": true,
  "tscNoEmitOk": true
}
