You are performing STORYBOOK STORIES REFACTOR ONLY for <componentName>.
Repeatable (idempotent). Do NOT assume any prior run.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (Ant Design):
https://ant.design/components/date-picker

TARGET FILE (ONLY FILE YOU MAY MODIFY):
src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.stories.tsx

AUTONOMY:
- No questions, no confirmations, no pausing.

HARD SCOPE:
- Extract examples ONLY from the page section labeled "Examples".
- Ignore all other sections (API, etc.).
- You may ONLY modify the TARGET FILE. If any other file needs changes → FAIL.

DEPENDENCY SAFETY (HARD RULE):
- You MUST NOT add/install packages or edit package.json.
- You MUST NOT add .d.ts files.
- You MUST NOT import from any package not already present in node_modules.
- If an Example requires a missing external package/theme/provider:
  - Implement a LOCAL-EQUIVALENT story using existing deps only
  - Story export name must include `Adapted`
  - Add a 1-line comment stating what dependency was avoided

MANDATE:
- Rewrite/merge the TARGET FILE so stories mirror the docs "Examples".
- This work is NOT complete until coverage reaches TOTAL/TOTAL.
- Coverage counts Adapted stories as covered if they clearly map to that Example title.

TEMPLATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Use my CSF3 template format (Meta<Args> + docs.page + dynamic source.transform)
- 1+ story export per Example (NO placeholders)

DATEPICKER-SPECIFIC NOTE (STILL GENERIC IN BEHAVIOR):
- Many Examples are for multiple demo surfaces (e.g., DatePicker vs RangePicker, presets, disabled dates, showTime, variants).
- Implement stories using the SAME surface shown in the Example (DatePicker/RangePicker/etc.).
- If the Example demonstrates a subcomponent surface, your story must use that subcomponent surface.

HARD EXTRACTION REQUIREMENT (NO FAKE COUNTS):
- Build the Examples list by reading the "Examples" section and extracting:
  - Example title text (exact)
  - The demo surface used (e.g., DatePicker, RangePicker, TimePicker if present, etc.)
- If you cannot extract titles reliably, STOP AND FAIL (do not proceed with partial guesses).

OUTPUT JSON 1 — EXAMPLES_INDEX (MUST BE REAL):
{
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "totalExamples": <TOTAL>,
  "exampleTitles": ["..."],
  "exampleSurfaces": [{ "title": "...", "surface": "DatePicker|RangePicker|Other" }]
}

CURRENT FILE INDEX (REQUIRED):
- Read the CURRENT TARGET FILE and list current story exports.

OUTPUT JSON 2 — CURRENT_STORIES_INDEX:
{
  "currentStoryExports": ["..."],
  "currentStoryCount": <N>
}

COVERAGE (REQUIRED):
- coveredExamples: Example titles that have matching story exports (exact title match OR clearly mapped name)
- missingExamples: remaining titles

OUTPUT JSON 3 — COVERAGE:
{
  "coveredCount": <X>,
  "totalExamples": <TOTAL>,
  "coverage": "<X>/<TOTAL>",
  "missingExamples": ["..."]
}

HARD EXECUTION GATE (PREVENTS “IT DID NOTHING”):
- If coverage is not TOTAL/TOTAL, you MUST:
  - add story exports for ALL missingExamples
  - and increase currentStoryCount by at least (TOTAL - X)
- If the file changes but story export count does not increase when missingExamples existed → FAIL.

EXECUTION:
- Add/fix stories so every Example title is represented (exact or adapted).
- Remove stories that do not map to any Example.
- Keep the template structure intact.

MODULE SHAPE + IMPORT SANITY (HARD — PREVENTS “UNABLE TO INDEX” / DUPLICATE IDENTIFIERS):
- The stories file MUST be a single clean module:
  - exactly ONE `const meta = { ... }`
  - exactly ONE `export default meta`
  - no stray pasted code after the final story export (only whitespace/comments allowed)
- Imports must be deduped:
  - exactly ONE import line for `Meta` and `StoryObj`
  - do NOT import the same identifier twice (Meta, StoryObj, React, etc.)
- If violated, normalize/fix these issues BEFORE making any example changes.

STORYBOOK INDEXER GATE (HARD — CATCHES BABEL-ONLY FAILURES THAT `tsc` CAN MISS):
- After edits, you MUST run BOTH checks:
  1) npx tsc --noEmit
  2) Storybook smoke/index check using the first command that exists (do not ask):
     a) npm run storybook -- --smoke-test --quiet
     b) npx storybook@latest dev --smoke-test --quiet
     c) npx storybook@latest build --quiet
- If output contains any of:
  - "Unable to index"
  - "Identifier 'X' has already been declared"
  - "SyntaxError:"
  then you MUST fix it by editing ONLY the TARGET FILE and re-run the Storybook check until clean.

VALIDATION:
- Run: npx tsc --noEmit
- Fix TS errors by changing ONLY the TARGET FILE.
- If TS errors cannot be fixed without touching other files → FAIL.

CHANGE VERIFICATION:
- Run: git diff --name-only
- If missingExamples existed and TARGET FILE is not changed → FAIL

FINAL OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "status": "TYPESCRIPT_CLEAN",
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "coverage": "<TOTAL>/<TOTAL>",
  "adaptedExamples": ["..."],
  "newStoryExportsAdded": <K>,
  "storybookIndexOk": true
}
