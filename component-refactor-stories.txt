You are performing STORYBOOK STORIES REFACTOR ONLY for <componentName>.
This prompt MUST be repeatable and MUST NOT assume any prior run.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (Ant Design):
<PASTE_ANTD_COMPONENT_URL_HERE>

TARGET FILE (ONLY FILE YOU MAY MODIFY):
src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.stories.tsx

AUTONOMY:
- No questions, no confirmations, no pausing.

HARD SCOPE:
- Extract examples ONLY from the page section labeled "Examples".
- Ignore all other sections (API, etc.).
- You may ONLY modify the TARGET FILE. If any other file needs changes → FAIL.

MANDATE:
- You MUST rewrite/merge the TARGET FILE so Storybook stories mirror the docs Examples.
- This work is NOT complete until coverage reaches TOTAL/TOTAL.

TEMPLATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
The story file MUST follow my template structure:
- CSF3 with `const meta = { ... } satisfies Meta<Args>;`
- addon-docs blocks + docs.page sections in this exact order:
  Title, Subtitle, Description,
  Usage guidelines (When to use / When not to use),
  Design checklist,
  Playground (DocsPrimary),
  Variables (Controls),
  Stories
- `docs.source.transform` with `type: "dynamic"` generating JSX from args
- 1+ story per Example (no placeholder stories)

CHECKS (REQUIRED — MUST OUTPUT):
A) Extract Example titles from the "Examples" section and compute TOTAL:
B) Read the CURRENT TARGET FILE and extract current story exports (e.g. `export const X`)
C) Compute coverage:
   - coveredExamples: Example titles that have matching stories (title match or clearly mapped)
   - missingExamples: Example titles not yet represented
   - coverage: "<coveredCount>/<totalExamples>"

OUTPUT JSON 1 — EXAMPLES_INDEX:
{
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "totalExamples": <TOTAL>,
  "exampleTitles": ["..."]
}

OUTPUT JSON 2 — CURRENT_STORIES_INDEX:
{
  "currentStoryExports": ["..."],
  "currentStoryCount": <N>
}

OUTPUT JSON 3 — COVERAGE:
{
  "coveredCount": <X>,
  "totalExamples": <TOTAL>,
  "coverage": "<X>/<TOTAL>",
  "missingExamples": ["..."]
}

EXECUTION:
- If coverage is not TOTAL/TOTAL:
  - Update the TARGET FILE to add/fix stories so missingExamples are implemented
  - Keep stories that already correctly match examples
  - Remove stories that do not correspond to any Example
- If coverage is already TOTAL/TOTAL:
  - Still normalize the file to match the template if it deviates

VALIDATION:
- Run: npx tsc --noEmit
- Fix any TS errors caused by story changes until ZERO errors remain.

CHANGE VERIFICATION:
- Run: git diff --name-only
- If coverage was not TOTAL/TOTAL and TARGET FILE is not changed → FAIL

FINAL OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
{
  "status": "TYPESCRIPT_CLEAN",
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "coverage": "<X>/<TOTAL>"
}
