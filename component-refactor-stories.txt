You are performing STORYBOOK STORIES REFACTOR ONLY for <componentName>.
Repeatable (idempotent). Do NOT assume any prior run.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (Ant Design):
https://ant.design/components/button

TARGET FILE (ONLY FILE YOU MAY MODIFY):
src/components/<componentName>/<componentName>.stories.tsx

AUTONOMY:
- No questions, no confirmations, no pausing.

HARD SCOPE:
- Extract examples ONLY from the page section labeled "Examples".
- Ignore all other sections (API, etc.).
- You may ONLY modify the TARGET FILE. If any other file needs changes → FAIL.

DEPENDENCY SAFETY (HARD RULE — PREVENTS THE SAME ISSUE):
- You MUST NOT add/install packages.
- You MUST NOT add .d.ts files.
- You MUST NOT import from any package that is not already present in package.json / node_modules.
- If an Example requires an external package/theme/provider not already available:
  - DO NOT replicate it verbatim.
  - Implement a LOCAL-EQUIVALENT story that demonstrates the same concept using only existing deps.
  - Mark the story name with "(Adapted)" and include a short comment explaining what dependency was avoided.

MANDATE:
- You MUST rewrite/merge the TARGET FILE so Storybook stories mirror the docs Examples.
- This work is NOT complete until coverage reaches TOTAL/TOTAL.
- Coverage counts adapted stories as covered if they map to a docs Example title.

TEMPLATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
The story file MUST follow my template structure:
- CSF3 with `const meta = { ... } satisfies Meta<Args>;`
- addon-docs blocks + docs.page sections in this exact order:
  Title, Subtitle, Description,
  Usage guidelines (When to use / When not to use),
  Design checklist,
  Playground (DocsPrimary),
  Variables (Controls),
  Stories
- `docs.source.transform` with `type: "dynamic"` generating JSX from args
- 1+ story per Example (no placeholder stories)

EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Each story MUST match the Example’s UI behavior and structure as closely as possible:
  - same variant intent (primary/dashed/link/text)
  - same state behavior (loading/disabled/danger)
  - same layout (group/space)
  - same icons if already available (e.g. @ant-design/icons)
- If a visual effect is tied to an unavailable theme/provider:
  - replicate the behavior concept using built-in props or CSS-in-story ONLY
  - do not introduce new global CSS files or shared utilities

PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (REQUIRED — BEFORE EDITING):
- Scan the docs Examples you plan to implement and list any imports/providers/packages they appear to require.
- Verify each required package exists locally.
- If missing, plan an adapted implementation.

OUTPUT JSON 1 — EXAMPLES_INDEX:
{
  "component": "<componentName>",
  "totalExamples": <TOTAL>,
  "exampleTitles": ["..."]
}

OUTPUT JSON 2 — DEPENDENCY_CHECK:
{
  "missingDepsDetected": ["<pkgName>", "..."],
  "examplesNeedingAdaptation": ["<Example title>", "..."]
}

OUTPUT JSON 3 — COVERAGE_PLAN:
{
  "storiesPlanned": [
    { "exampleTitle": "...", "storyExport": "...", "mode": "exact|adapted" }
  ]
}

EXECUTION:
- Update TARGET FILE to:
  - add/fix stories for all missing Examples (exact or adapted)
  - keep correct stories
  - remove stories that don't map to any Example title
- If coverage already TOTAL/TOTAL:
  - still normalize to the template if it deviates
  - still re-check dependencies and adapt if needed

VALIDATION:
- Run: npx tsc --noEmit
- Fix TypeScript errors by changing ONLY the TARGET FILE.
- If TS errors cannot be fixed without touching other files → FAIL.

CHANGE VERIFICATION:
- Run: git diff --name-only
- If TARGET FILE is not changed when work was required → FAIL

FINAL OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
